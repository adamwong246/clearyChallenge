# 2nd Cleary Challenge

Build a Rails + React application that, given a specific github username, will output a list of people that user has interacted with on github using the github api (https://developer.github.com/v3/), and have some kind of way to rank them.

Create an app with 2 pages - one with a table view ranking interaction types, and one that has a suggestion box similar to the one in the screenshot above

- Table view: a list of other github users ranked based on some interactions that the user has had with them in github.
 - It should be designed to support different types of interactions
 - At a minimum, you should consider pull request comments as an interaction type
 - The table should have filters that allow you to slice the data by date range
 - The table columns should be sortable

- Suggested shoutout UI
 - Similar to the one in the screenshot above
 - You can ignore the actual shoutout sending (don't need to implement a modal to actually send the shoutout)
 - Determine the algorithm used to show the suggested users based on data from the table view

Additional Considerations
- Performance - when and how often does the data get computed? How would you store this data so it’s performant?
- Extensibility - what if we wanted to add something like bitbucket as a new data source?
- Validations - are the models using appropriate validations to ensure data integrity?

Bonus Challenge
- In addition to pull request comments, support additional interaction types (for example, when someone is @mentioned, reactions, issues, approvers, reviewers, etc)
- Implement the actual shoutouts that can be sent to other users
- Create a feed of each interaction on the homepage below the suggested shoutouts box
- For example: DHH commented on tenderlove’s PR
